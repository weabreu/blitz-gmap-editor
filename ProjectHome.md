Blitz GMap Editor allows the user to create custom maps using GMAP version 3 API.

  1. Users are able to draw elements on the Map and apply styles using the DrawingManager provided in GMAP API version 3
  1. Users will be able to export the created map as a JSON object which can further be stored in database.
  1. The stored JSON map can again be retrieved and displayed in Edit or non-edit mode as required.
  1. Export the map as KML.
